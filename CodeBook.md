# Dataset
This dataset was built from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset"  
from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains the following data
- Data from 30 volunteers with age from 19 to 48 years
- People performed six activities: Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs,  
  Sitting, Standing, and Laying. This data was collected while wearing a Samsung  
  Galaxy S II smartphone on the waist. Data was collected by using the accelerometer
  and gyroscope sensors of the smartphone: 3-axial linear acceleration and  
  3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.
